# networkSanity
Network Sanity checker

It happens often to me that my router Beacon packets are not transmitted by my router, thereby rendering my WiFi unavailable.
In such cases my computer is quick to latch on to whatever open network it finds available. This clearly is dangerous as potentially malicious networks can keep their networks open and thus inviting victims.

This python script asks the user to blacklist networks that user feels are not safe. Also, it keeps checking if the user's home network is back live and connects the system to the User's network.
The script is written for windows based systems. A little change to system commands can suit the script for Linux environments.

Use the script in whatever way you feel like. :|)
